    <p><font size=6>If you want to pursue this career, you have to have at least a basic understanding of a computer's components and how the function together.</p>
    <p><font size=5>Computer hardware engineers use computers not only to design and construct the components for a computer, but they also have to have the knowledge necessary to program said parts. They have to program a part to not only work by itself, but also have to have knowledge of how other parts are designed and work so that the individual part can work in tandem with the others.</p>
